SQL Ecommerce Analysis Project

In this project, I worked with an ecommerce dataset (Amazon Sale Report.csv) and used DB Browser for SQLite to perform different SQL operations as required.
I have attached the CSV file used, along with a DOC file containing all query outputs and screenshots.

After importing the dataset into SQLite, I explored the table structure and prepared a few fields (like Amount and Qty) so they could be used properly in calculations.
From there, I completed all the SQL tasks given in the hints.

What I did:

Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY to explore, filter, and summarize the data.

Applied SUM, AVG, COUNT to calculate revenue, average order amounts, top categories, and SKU performance.

Wrote subqueries to compare SKU revenue against averages and find latest order statuses.

Created helper tables and performed INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and a RIGHT JOIN equivalent to analyze relationships between orders, products, and items.

Built a view to easily summarize each order.

Added indexes on key columns to improve performance.

Overall, the project covers the complete workflow of importing data, analyzing it with SQL, and generating insights.
All results and screenshots are included in the attached DOC file.
